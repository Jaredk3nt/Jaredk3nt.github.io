Each class has their own unique **hit points**, **equipment**, **proficiencies**, and **skill tree** that the player can follow. In-depth descriptions on all of these class attributes can be <u>found in each specific link</u> to www.roll20.net (a great resource for lookups on 5e), but quick summaries of the classes can be found below.

#### Barbarian

The relentless combatant, fueled by fury or their totem bond with animals. They are in tune with the natural order.

They are **damage sponges** and **melee burst damage characters**. They have the highest possible hit dice size in the game, which directly translates to having massive maximum HP on top of natural armor that scales off of two modifiers. They also can Rage as a limited resource which gives them tremendous accuracy on their hits along with other bonuses.

#### Bard

They are story tellers or musicians using wits, magic, and lore to get out of (or avoid) tight situations.

Their main goal is to be an **amplifier** for the effectiveness of the rest of the party, with a secondary 'focus' on being a **jack of all trades**. Their Bardic Inspiration ability gives significant bonuses to a d20 roll to a person of your choice. They get many, many skill proficiencies on top of being good at the things they aren't even proficient in (via the feature literally called Jack of All Trades). They get spells from other classes as they level, and can also specialize into melee via one of their subclass options.

#### Cleric

Holy person devoted to a specific deity. They are capable of bolstering the party and healing their wounds, or hitting their enemies with divine wrath.

With *seven* different domains the cleric can be used in many different directions. They are typically used as **defensive supports** by using magic and stregth to keep the party going through tough situations. They can also use **utility magic** out of combat to help out the party.

#### Druid

Nomads devoted to the world and the powers of Nature. They are capable of adopting the form of a beast for battle or utility. While also capable of bolstering the party and healing their wounds, or hitting their enemies with nature's wrath.

Druids split into two typical paths, the **Circle of the Land** and **Circle of the Moon** classes, but for both are typically great scouts and can possess a lot of out of combat **utility magic**. The former tend to rely on prepared tools and talismans for their spells, whereas the latter use disposable extra heath and appropriate beast transformations to fight. Both can shapeshift based on their knowledge of beast but the **Circle of the Moon** tend to be far stronger.

#### Fighter

Skilled combatant or strategist typically relying on heavy armor and weapons to cut down their enemies. Their specific type of training will give them unique abilities.

Fighers are, if nothing else, **consistent martial combatants**. They get good static combat bonuses through their fighting style, they have a regular number of extra attacks that they always have the option of using, and they have Action Surges and Second Winds to do more of what they're good at. They have proficiency in every weapon and armor. They have **relatively little going for them outside of combat** other than their natural physical prowess, but they get the **highest base stat totals** through their much more frequent Ability Score Improvements. They also have some pretty interesting subclasses. One simply makes them better at what they already do. Another gives them incredible versatility in combat via maneuvers that let them control the battlefield. A third enhances their martial prowess with limited Wizard abilities.

#### Monk

Martial artists using their intensily honed bodies to destroy their enemies.

Monk's are **hard to pin down**. They get a special resource, Ki, which lets them maneuver around or be evasive extremely well when necessary. They are naturally fast and are extremely good at shrugging off effects and doing saving throws. Their subclasses can make them fairly stealthy, give them access to a limited number of elemental spells, or enhance their natural martial art capabilities.

#### Paladin

If Clerics are the defensive supports of the party, Paladins are the **frontline supports**. Like Fighters, they're proficient with all weapons and armors. They have a natural healing pool that they can spend any amount of at a time to heal an ally they touch. Their spells focus pretty heavily on controlling the playing field, either through making sure your side's healthy and doing well, or through making sure their side's not doing anything you don't want. The Oath of Devotion Paladin enhances the defensive support aspects of the paladin, the Oath of the Ancients paladin enhances their controlling and tanking aspects, and the Oath of Vengeance paladin is *damn good* at taking down a single target.

#### Ranger

Rangers use a blend of knowledge of the natural word and martial ability to become deadly hunters. They can fight with both ranged and melee weapons or even have pets.

Rangers are a **high utility martial class**. They are extremely good at being out in the wild, being **skilled trackers and survivors**, particularly in their favored terrain. They have several nature spells to compliment their skill set, some of which enhance their combat ability, others of which enhance their out of combat utility. Their combat prowess isn't quite top of the line in exchange for this versatility, though in the right situation they get right back up there.

#### Rogue

Typically thiefs or assassins they will use their ability to pick out an enemies weaknesses to dispose of them in a quick and stealthy manner.

They are the **specialist** class. They are extremely effective in very specific areas of focus. In combat, they're very potent against distracted targets or targets they otherwise have an advantage over. Out of combat, they have supreme prowess in the proficiencies they've chosen to put their expertise in.

#### Sorcerer

Magic users who draw their magical ability from within and summoning spells and abilities.

Sorcerers can convert spell slots into other level spell slots via Font of Magic. They have **flexibility**, as for a given spell slot level they will always be able to cast more spells (of that level) per day than the other classes (at the expense of spell slots of other levels)

#### Warlock

Pacted with a powerful entity warlocks trade something physical for their magical abilities.

Warlocks have Invocations and other class features that make them **consistent** compared to the other classes. They regain their spell slots on short rests and have Invocations to make Cantrips and melee attacks more appealing. They gain the ability to cast certain spells at will instead of requiring spell slots, and have useful class features that don't require the use of their spells.

#### Wizard

Keepers of ancient arcane knowledge that they can use to manipulate magic and spells.

Wizard's spellbook gives them access to more spells available for them to cast; they can *prepare* more spells than the other two can even *learn*, and know even more spells than that. They are the most **versatile** casters.
