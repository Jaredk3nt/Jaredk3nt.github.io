1. **Describe Your Character**

   Spend time thinking about how your character behaves and their motivations.

   *Important factors:*

   - Alignment (moral compass) 
   - Ideals
   - Bonds (things you hold dear)
   - Flaws

   Use your ability scores to determine traits of your character

   - A high intelligence character may have good judgement and awareness rather than a low who could be brash and confused. OR a character with high charisma can exude confidence with a graceful or intimidating presence vs someone with low may come across as timid or abrasive.


1. **Choose Equipment**

   **Armor Class**

   > How well your character avoids being wounded in battle

   When you attack roll d20 and add proficiency bonus (if proficient with weapon)

   - Melee weapons
       - Strength modifier for both attack and damage rolls
       - Weapons with *finesse* modifier can use dexterity mod instead
