Welcome to my casual guide on how to get started playing DnD. I am a beginner myself so this is my condensation of the Player Basic Rules v03. This will guide you through the rule set you should know before you start playing (like rolling and character creation) and then give you the basic rule set on what you need to know throughout your adventure. Let's Quest!

### Summary

> *More information to each portion can be found in the more verbose later sections.*

Before we start playing we need to understand some of the basics of the game. This includes *roleplaying*, *rolling*, and how to *create our character*. 

Roleplaying is how we portray our character in the game. The two main ways are **descriptive**, describing how your character acts in the world, and **active**, acting as your character.

In the game all events are determined by **dice rolls**. Depending on the situation your DM will tell you what kind to roll (d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, d4). Most commonly for character actions we will use d20 to determine success or failure. In certain situations there can also be *advantage* and *disadvantage* that will affect your rolls.

To **create our character** we need to do 4 things:

1. Choose your race
   - dragonborn, dwarf, halfing, elf, gnome, tiefling, human, half-elf, half-orc
   - [*Practical Guide to the Races of DnD*](races.html)
2. Choose your class
   - Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
   - [*Practical Guide to the Classes of DnD*](classes.html)
3. Determine ability points
4. Describe your character
5. Choose equipment

Once we have set up our characters and we understand the basics we can get started on our adventure! There are alot of things that can happen along our quest so lets start to learn the rules of the world.

Our character has a set of 6 ability scores that make up *who they are and what they are good at*, the small number under this score is the **modifer** and will discern how these are practically used. Whenever our character has to do something in-game they will make an **ability check**. Your character rolls a d20 dice and adds the relevant modifier, if it is greater than or equal to the *difficulty* of the action you do it. One special type of action is called a **saving throw** that you will take to resist *spells*, *traps*, *posion*, or any similar thing.

During our adventure our character has physical limitations like **speed**, **hunger & thirst**, **vision**, and **environmental damage**.

You can rest along your adventure to regain HP. There are both **short** and **long** rests. Short allow you to heal and use hit dice, while long auto refill your HP and regen hit dice.

**Combat** is a very important part of DnD so lets take a look. Combat is broken into rounds where each character in the fight takes a turn in order (based on **initiative roll**).

*How combat will run in each instance:*

Determine suprise - Establish positions - Roll Initiative - Take turns - Begin next round



# The REAL Guide

## Before you play

### Roleplaying

Decide how you will portray your character throughout the adventure. This is key in guiding interactions and gameplay.

1. Descriptive Roleplaying

   You describe your characters words & actions as you see them happening in your imagination.

   "Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stoms over to the bar."

   - describe emotions & attitude
   - characters intent 
   - embellish liberally

2. Active Roleplaying

   You speak as your character, like an actor taking on a role. You can even mimic movements and body language to make it more descriptive.

### Rolling

> Whenever you divide a number you round DOWN

###### D20

Used to determine success or failure in actions taken

Steps to using the roll:

- Roll & add relevent modifier
  - Modifier is derived from one of the 6 ability scores or a proficiency bonus
- Apply circumstantial bonuses/penalties
- Compare this roll to "target" number
  - Difficulty Class
    - Checking for "saving throw"
  - Armor Class
    - Target for a hitting attack, different for every character

###### Advantage & Disadvantage

Modifiers based on special situations

**Advantage:** a positive circumstance around a d20 roll

- Roll 2 d20, use the higher of the 2 rolls

**Disadvantage:** a negative circumstance around a d20 roll

- Roll 2 d20, use the lower of the 2 rolls



### Creating a Character

###### The overview

1. **Choose a Race**

   *Common:* dwarves, elves, halflings, humans

   Some races have **subraces** to choose from.

   Your race helps define your background, general appearance, and natural talents (proficiencies)

   Race can improve 1 or more of your ability scores

   Record all traits gained by race on character sheet (languages, speed, etc.)

2. **Choose a Class**

   Defines talents and tactics in the adventure

   Gain **class feature** benefits & capabilities

   **Proficiencies**

   - armor (heavy, light, etc)
   - weapons
   - skills (bluffing, sneaking, etc)
   - saving throws
   - tools

   **Proficiency Bonuses**

   > +2 for a lv. 1

   This is a bonus that applies to many of the numbers you will be recording on your sheet.

   - attack rolls using weapons you're prficient with
   - Attack rolls with spells you cast
   - Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
   - Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
   - Saving throws you’re proficient in
   - Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

   **Hit points & Hit die**

   At lv. 1 your character has 1 hit die which is determined by class.

   HP = die type + constitution mod

3. **Determine Ability Scores**

   > Stregth, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom & Charisma

   **Generation**

   *Method 1:*

   ​	Roll 4 d6 and record the highest 3 (repeat 5 more times)

   *Method 2:*

   ​	Use ability array = {15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8} 

   Assign 6 numbers in any way you want to your ability scores and add any changes as a result of your race.

   Determine **ability modifiers**:

   - (Ability Score - 10)/2 = Ability Modifier

   | Ability Score | Measures                          | Important to      | Racial increases                         |
   | ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | Strength      | Athleticism, Power                | Fighter           | Mountain dwarf(+2), Human(+1)            |
   | Dexterity     | Agility, Reflexes, Balance, Poise | Rogue             | Elf(+2), Human(+1), Halfling(+2)         |
   | Constitution  | Health, Stamina, Vital force      | Everyone          | Dwarf(+2), Stout halfling(+1), Human(+1) |
   | Intelligence  | Acuity, Recall, Analytics         | Wizard            | High elf(+1), Human(+1)                  |
   | Wisdom        | Awareness, Intuition, Insight     | Cleric            | Hill dwarf(+1), Wood elf(+1), Human(+1)  |
   | Charisma      | Confidence, Eloquence, Leadership | Leaders/Diplomats | Lightfoot halfling(+1), Human(+1)        |


1. **Describe Your Character**

   Spend time thinking about how your character behaves and their motivations.

   *Important factors:*

   - Alignment (moral compass) 
   - Ideals
   - Bonds (things you hold dear)
   - Flaws

   Use your ability scores to determine traits of your character

   - A high intelligence character may have good judgement and awareness rather than a low who could be brash and confused. OR a character with high charisma can exude confidence with a graceful or intimidating presence vs someone with low may come across as timid or abrasive.


1. **Choose Equipment**

   **Armor Class**

   > How well your character avoids being wounded in battle

   *Contributors:*	armor, shield, dexterity

   Without any armor your characters **AC** is 10 + dexterity mod

   With armor you calculate your **AC** like so:

   **Weapons**

   When you attack roll d20 and add proficiency bonus (if proficient with weapon)

   - Melee weapons
       - Strength modifier for both attack and damage rolls
       - Weapons with *finesse* modifier can use dexterity mod instead
   - Ranged weapons
     - Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls
     - *Thrown weapons* can use stregth mod instead


### The specifics

1. **Choosing a Race**

   [*Practical Guide to the Races of DnD*](races.html)

   *Racial Traits:*

   - Ability score increase
     - each race increases one or more ability scores
   - Age
     - Notes when a member of a race is considered an adult and life expectancy
     - Age can be used to explain ability scores (older may have low strength but high wisdom etc.)
   - Alignment
     - Most races have a tendency towards particular alignments (but are not binding)
   - Size
     - Most races are *Medium* sized (4-8 ft tall)
     - Some are *Small* (2-4 ft tall)
     - Use this to decide how certain things in the game affect your character (small characters will have trouble handling heavy weapons etc.)
   - Speed
     - Determines how far you can move while traveling & fighting
   - Languages
     - Each race can initially speak certain languages that will affect how they can interact with others in the world
   - Subraces
     - Sub-races have the traits of the parent race in addition to the trains specified for their sub-race and can affect how they interact with others of their own race

## Playing the Game

### Using Ability Scores

A score of 10-11 is a normal human average, but adventurers and monsters tend to be a cut above average. A score of 18 is a typical high but characters can reach 20 and some monsters can be as high as 30.

> Calculate modifiers with (Ability score - 10) / 2 = Modifier

A modifier is usually more important than the raw score because these are used to effect events like attack roll, ability check, saving throw and more.

##### Advantage & Disadvantage In-depth

>**Advantage:** a positive circumstance around a d20 roll
>
>- Roll 2 d20, use the higher of the 2 rolls
>
>**Disadvantage:** a negative circumstance around a d20 roll
>
>- Roll 2 d20, use the lower of the 2 rolls

Advantages & disadvantages do not stack, even against multiple you only roll one extra d20.

A&D cancel out if even and become neutral

You gain A&D through use of special abilities, actions, or spells. The DM can also decide the circumstances that influence A&D.

##### Ability Checks

An event that tests a character or monster's talent to overcome a challenge.

DM can call for check when character or monster attempts an action that has a chance of failure, and decides the *difficulty class* or the action

*Difficulty class* decides how hard it is to overcome the action based on roll needed to succeed

| Task Difficulty   | D.C. |
| ----------------- | ---- |
| Very easy         | 5    |
| Easy              | 10   |
| Medium            | 15   |
| Hard              | 20   |
| Very Hard         | 25   |
| Nearly impossible | 30   |

You roll a d20 and add relevant modifier to pass ability check

###### Contents

A subset of checks where 2 characters are directly opposed and only one can succeed *ex. attempting to grab an object on floor, monster pushing door where character is pushing closed, etc.*

Both *characters* make relevant checks and the **higher** of the 2 rolls wins. Ties result in a stalemate.

###### Skills

Skills represent a specific niche of a ability score that a character can have a proficiency in (determined at character creation).

| Ability      | Skills                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Stregth      | Athletics                                |
| Dexterity    | Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth     |
| Intelligence | Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion |
| Wisdom       | Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival |
| Charisma     | Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion |

DM can ask for an ability check using a specific skill, or the player can ask if a skill applies to a check. 

Without a proficiency in the skill the individual makes a *normal ability check* with the over arching Ability Score

###### Passive Checks

An ability check that requires no dice roll that is often used for repetitive tasks or secret checks

Made using 10 + all mod that apply to check, then +5 for advantage or -5 for disadvantage

*ex. For a check to see if players notice a hidden monster a player has a wisdom score of 15 and proficiency in perception so the passive check score is 14*

###### Group Checks

If the task requires the whole group, everyone rolls and as long as **half the group succeeds** then everyone succeeds.

##### Saving Throws

Represents an attempt to resist a spell, trap, poison, disease, or any other similar threat.

Saving throws usually happen out of nessecity

To make a saving throw:

- roll d20 and add appropriate mod

Difficulty class of saving throw is determined by the cause *ex. spell saving throw is determined by casters spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus*

### Adventuring

##### Speed

###### Traveling pace

- Forced March
    - Assumes 8hr of travel in a day
    - To travel further you must make constitution saving throw each hour (D.C. is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8)
- Mounts & Vehicles
    - Mounted a character can ride 2x as fast for an hour
    - Depending on vehicle the pace is set, but can travel for longer times (see specific vehicles)
- Difficult Terrain
    - Dense forests, swamps, rubble, mountains, ice-covered ground
    - You move at 1/2 speed in difficult terrain 

 

| Pace   | Minute | Hour | Day   | Effect                                   |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Fast   | 400 ft | 4 mi | 30 mi | -5 to passive wisdom (perception) scores |
| Normal | 300 ft | 3 mi | 24 mi | --                                       |
| Slow   | 200 ft | 2 mi | 18 mi | Able to use stealth                      |

##### Environment

###### Falling

- *Lightly obscured:* (dim light, patchy fog, moderate foliage) creatures have **disadvantage on perception checks on sight**
- *Heavily obscured:* (darkness, opaque fog, etc.) creature suffers from the *blinded* condition
- *Bright light:* lets most creatures see normally
- *Dim light:* shadows, usually at the edge of bright light and darkness such as when using a torch.
- *Darkness:* outdoors at night, unlit dungeons, or magical darkness

Vision can be modified by multiple traits specific to certain races or creatures like *Blindsight, Darkvision*, and *Truesight*

###### Food & Water

- Requires 1 lb of food per day, but can go 3 + constitution mod. days without food. Each day beyond that causes them to suffer 1 lv. of exhaustion
- Require 1 gallon of water per day, or 2 gallons if the weather is *hot*.

#### Social Interaction

 The DM takes on the role of all NPC's the players will interact with in the world

| Friendly                | Indifferent                 | Hostile                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| predisposed to help you | don't give a shit about you | inclined to get in your way |

#### Resting

| Short                                    | Long                                     |

At the end a character regains all lost HP and spent hit dice (up to half of max). Can't perform a long rest more than once in 24 hours |

### Combat

#### Order of Combat

DnD organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds. During a round each player takes a **turn** in which they can **move** and take **one action**. 

> The order of turns is determined by rolling inititative at the beginning of an encounter (Dexterity check). 
>
> The DM rolls for groups of identical creatures, so they act at the same time.

Certain special abilities, spells, & situations allow you to take a **reaction** which is an instant response to a trigger of some kind.

You can break up your move by moving some amount, taking your action, and moving the remainder of your movement value.

**Standing** from prone takes effort equal to half your movement distance.

#### Actions in combat

##### Attack

Basic action where you attack with either melee or ranged weapon against an enemy.

To attack you:

1. Choose a target
2. Determine modifiers, advantage/disadvantage, etc
   - Strength modifier for melee
   - Dexterity modifier for ranged
   - Include proficiency bonus if proficient with weapon
3. Resolve the attack

To determine a **hit** on your enemy you roll a d20 and add appropriate modifier, if you overcome the enemy's **armor class** you hit and you can roll for damage.

**Special rolls** include 1 & 20. On roll of a 20 it is a *critical hit* and the attack hits no matter the enemies armor class. A 1 misses no matter the armor class.

##### Cast a Spell

If your character can use magic you can cast spells as an action. Follow the guide on your spell to know how to cast. Certain actions can have a casting time that is longer than a typical action and therefore will require different rules.

##### Dash

An action used to double your movement during your turn.

##### Disengage

Your movement no longer provokes opportunity attacks for the rest of turn

##### Dodge

Focus entirely on dodging incoming attacks. For the rest of the turn all invoming attacks have disadvantage and dexterity saving throws you roll have advantage.

##### Help

Lend aide to another character, they gain ability on their next action

##### Hide

Make a dexterity *stealth* check to attempt to hide

##### Ready

Set up for a *reaction* for some percievable action an enemy could take

##### Search

##### Use Object

###### Step by step

*How combat will run in each instance*

1. Determine suprise
2. Establish positions
3. Roll Initiative
4. Take turns
5. Begin next round
